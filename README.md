### Description:
As part of the training course offered by Udacity, we worked on a project to build a web page similar to Google's homepage. This project involved applying basic web design and development principles using HTML and CSS. HTML was used to create the structure of the page and include essential elements such as the search bar and logos. Additionally, CSS was applied to style and beautify the page, including setting colors, fonts, and arranging elements in a neat manner that mimics Google's simple and practical design. Through this project, we gained hands-on skills in user interface development and a deeper understanding of modern web designÂ principles.
### Tech stack:
1. HTML
2. CSS
